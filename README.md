# SIGNS-Image-Classification-using-ResNets
The code is in python. 
I have used the the following Architecture :  CONV2D -> BATCHNORM -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONVBLOCK -> IDBLOCK2 -> CONVBLOCK -> IDBLOCK3 -> CONVBLOCK -> IDBLOCK5 -> CONVBLOCK -> IDBLOCK2 -> AVGPOOL -> FLATTEN -> FCLAYER -> OUTPUT

CONVBLOCK AND IDBLOCK are implemented in model.py
